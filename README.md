# Hurtado_Gonzalo_Pablo_project-Bootstrap

# Repeat the HTML/CSS Project, but this time use Bootstrap.

You don't need to re-invent a brand or content for the web site, just use the same ones you created for the original project.

## For this Project:
1. Delete the CSS file.
2. Use all the Bootstrap default files.
3. After this, you may re-do some of the content CSS.
