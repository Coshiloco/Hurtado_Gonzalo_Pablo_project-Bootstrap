        <h2>We are not...</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Just another plant company that's only interested in selling you
            plants without considering their suitability for your environment.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            A company with a salesperson who will try to sell you every plant
            under the sun, then hands off your project to an intern who barely
            knows the difference between a succulent and a fern.
          </li>
